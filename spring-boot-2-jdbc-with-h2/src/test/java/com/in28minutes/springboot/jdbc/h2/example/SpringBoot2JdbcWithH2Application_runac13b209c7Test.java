The test case appears to be correct. The compilation errors described seem to be caused by illegal characters at the beginning of the file, not the test case itself. 

However, it seems like the `run()` method of `SpringBoot2JdbcWithH2Application` class is not visible or does not exist. If it does not exist, the `testRun()` method will fail. 

If the `run()` method does exist in `SpringBoot2JdbcWithH2Application`, make sure it is public so it can be accessed in the test. 

Also, ensure the test file does not start with illegal characters such as '`'. 

The test case itself seems to be correctly written and should not cause the compilation errors described.
